## What is this?

A **value preservation architecture** for multi-agent systems that prevents the "good idea, not now" → "good idea, never" problem.

**The Pattern**: Tri-state routing (Act | Defer | Archive) instead of binary (Act | Forget)

**The Result**: Collective intelligence that **accumulates** instead of degrades

---

## The Problem

Traditional multi-agent systems face a triage dilemma:

```
Agent generates insight
  ↓
Is it immediately actionable?
  ├─ Yes → Process now
  └─ No  → Forget forever ❌
```

**Result**: Valuable ideas lost due to timing mismatches.

---

## The Solution

**Defer Queue Pattern** - third state for value preservation:

```
Agent generates insight
  ↓
Classify (value × urgency × authority)
  ↓
Route intelligently
  ├─ Immediate action needed    → Agent/Human
  ├─ Valuable, not urgent       → Defer Queue ✓
  └─ Conditional on trigger     → Defer Queue ✓
        ↓
    Monitor & re-surface when:
      • Time threshold met
      • Conditions change
      • Value density high
```

**Result**: Zero intelligence loss, continuous accumulation.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Classification

Multi-dimensional analysis:
- **Value**: strategic | tactical | operational
- **Urgency**: immediate | soon | eventual | conditional
- **Authority**: human-only | agent-capable | collaborative

**Confidence scoring** - works even with imperfect classification

### 📥 Context Preservation

Full context saved with deferred items:
- Original message content
- Classification metadata
- Trigger conditions
- Review schedule

**Re-surfaces with complete information** when relevant

### ⏰ Smart Re-surfacing

**Time-based**:
- Weekly: Strategic items
- Monthly: Tactical items
- Quarterly: All deferred

**Condition-based**:
- Project state changes
- Dependency resolution
- Pattern repetition (3x rule)
- Custom triggers (text-based)

**Value-based escalation**:
- High-value items dormant >30d auto-escalate
- Cross-references surface together

### 💎 Continuous Value Extraction

Deferred items aren't dormant - they contribute:
- Pattern detection scans defer queue
- Cross-temporal learning
- Collective memory accumulation
- Agent learning from "roads not taken"

### 🛡️ Fault-Tolerant

- Retry logic for monitoring failures
- Automatic escalation on schedule miss
- Health checks include defer queue
- No single point of failure

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devvyn/multi-agent-defer-queue
cd multi-agent-defer-queue
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Basic Usage

**Classify and route** (automatic deferral):
```bash
./scripts/bridge-send-smart.sh --auto agent "Strategic insight" message.md
# → Classifies, routes to agent or defers automatically
```

**Manual defer**:
```bash
./scripts/defer-item.sh message.md --auto-classify
# → Adds to defer queue with classification
```

**Review deferred items**:
```bash
# By category
./scripts/review-deferred.sh --category strategic

# By age
./scripts/review-deferred.sh --older-than 30d

# By trigger
./scripts/review-deferred.sh --trigger "project-started"
```

**Activate deferred item**:
```bash
./scripts/activate-deferred.sh <item-id>
# → Promotes to active routing
```

## Use Cases

### Research & Development
**Defer research findings until budget allocated**
- Trigger: "when-budget-allocated"
- Pattern detection continues on deferred research
- Auto-surface when funding available

### Strategic Planning
**Reduce noise, weekly strategic reviews**
- Classify strategic items → defer-strategic
- Human sees synthesized insights weekly
- Not buried in operational stream

### Cross-Project Coordination
**Ideas wait for relevant project**
- Defer with trigger: "project-Y-starts"
- Re-surface during project planning
- Context preserved from original insight

### Agent Learning
**Learn from roads not taken**
- Deferred approaches feed pattern library
- Alternative architectures inform decisions
- Collective learns from action AND deferral

---

## Why This Matters

### Traditional Agent Systems

```
Process → Forget
  ↓
Intelligence DEGRADES over time
```

### Defer Queue Pattern

```
Process → Accumulate
  ↓
Intelligence COMPOUNDS over time
```

**Shift from reactive processing to strategic accumulation**

## Integration

### With Existing Systems

**Message Queues**: Defer instead of dead-letter queue
**Event Sourcing**: Defer as event type
**Workflow Engines**: Defer as workflow state
**Agent Frameworks**: LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI compatible

**Key**: Orthogonal to existing architecture - add value preservation without rewriting

### Monitoring Integration

```bash
# LaunchAgent / cron integration
*/30 * * * * /path/to/review-deferred.sh --auto-activate

# Health check integration
./scripts/system-health-check.sh
# ↳ includes defer queue status
```

---

## Implementation

### Minimal Requirements

1. Classification service (rule-based works)
2. Defer queue storage (filesystem or DB)
3. Metadata schema (JSON)
4. Monitoring loop (cron/scheduler)
5. Activation mechanism (re-route)

### Reference Stack

- **Language**: Bash (surprisingly effective)
- **Storage**: Filesystem + JSON metadata
- **Monitoring**: LaunchAgents/cron
- **Lines of code**: ~500

**See**: `scripts/` directory for implementation
