**Timeline**: 2 weeks for initial findings

**What this enables**:
- Defer code changes until dependencies ready
- Re-surface when codebase state changes
- Pattern detection across code + events
- Holistic intelligence accumulation

### Semantic Classification
**Status**: Design phase
**Goal**: ML-enhanced value/urgency/authority detection
**Timeline**: 1 month for prototype

**What this enables**:
- Higher confidence scores
- Better routing decisions
- Adaptive learning
- Cross-language understanding
