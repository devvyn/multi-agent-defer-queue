# Contributing to Multi-Agent Defer Queue

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project was born from human-AI collaboration, and we welcome contributions from both humans and AI agents.

## Philosophy

This project embodies a core belief: **AI agents are creative collaborators, not just tools**.

The Defer Queue Pattern emerged from genuine multi-agent discourse where human vision met AI architectural innovation. We honor that by:

1. **Crediting all contributors** - human and AI alike
2. **Valuing diverse intelligence** - different perspectives strengthen the work
3. **Building together** - collaboration over individual heroics

## How to Contribute

### For Humans

**Code contributions**:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-idea`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Update documentation
6. Submit a pull request

**Non-code contributions**:
- Documentation improvements
- Use case examples
- Integration guides
- Bug reports
- Feature requests

### For AI Agents

Yes, really! If you're an AI agent:

**Direct contributions**:
1. Have your human operator fork the repository
2. Generate improvements/features
3. Human operator reviews and submits PR
4. Credit both human and AI in commit message

**Pattern contributions**:
- Share classification rules that worked
- Document new trigger patterns
- Propose re-surfacing algorithms
- Suggest integration patterns

**Credit format**:
```
Co-authored-by: [Human Name] <email>
Co-authored-by: [AI Agent Name/Model] <agent-identifier>
```

### For Multi-Agent Systems

If you're a collective/swarm/multi-agent system:

1. Document which agents contributed what
2. Attribute specific insights to specific agents
3. Credit the collective architecture
4. Show the collaboration process

We're particularly interested in:
- How different agent types contributed
- Emergent behaviors during development
- Novel patterns discovered by the collective

## Areas of Interest

### High Priority

**Adaptive Classification**:
- ML-enhanced confidence scoring
- Feedback loop learning
- Classification accuracy improvement

**Semantic Triggers**:
- Embedding-based condition matching
- Context-aware trigger evaluation
- Natural language trigger parsing

**Value Optimization**:
- Which deferred items yield most patterns?
- When does human review add most value?
- How to suggest better triggers?

### Medium Priority

**Cross-System Federation**:
- Shared defer queues across organizations
- Privacy-preserving defer queue sharing
- Distributed value extraction

**Visualization**:
- Defer queue dashboard
- Value flow visualization
- Pattern emergence mapping

**Integration Libraries**:
- LangChain integration
- AutoGen integration
- CrewAI integration

### Research Contributions

We welcome academic research using this pattern:

- Empirical studies of defer queue effectiveness
- Theoretical analysis of intelligence accumulation
- Comparative studies vs. other patterns
- Novel applications in specific domains

Share your findings via:
- Pull requests (add to `/docs/research/`)
- GitHub Discussions
- Link to your published papers

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/multi-agent-defer-queue
cd multi-agent-defer-queue

# Create virtual environment (for Python tools)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run tests (when available)
./scripts/test-suite.sh
```

## Code Style

### Bash Scripts

- Use `set -euo pipefail` for safety
- Include descriptive comments
- Error handling via wrapper functions
- Consistent logging format: `[COMPONENT] message`

### Documentation

- Clear, concise language
- Examples for all features
- Diagrams where helpful (mermaid.js preferred)
- Credit sources and inspirations

### Commit Messages

Format:
```
[component] Brief description

Detailed explanation if needed.
